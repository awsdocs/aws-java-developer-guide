########################

This repository contains source content for the official `AWS Java Developer Guide`_. The source
code for the `AWS SDK for Java`_ is also on GitHub, at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/.

The guide content is written in reStructuredText_ and built using Sphinx_. It relies upon content
which is provided in the AWS documentation team's `shared content`_ and `SDK examples`_
repositories.

AWS SDK for Java 2.0 Developer Preview
======================================
Take a look at the new AWS SDK for Java 2.0 developer preview at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/.
It includes much awaited features, such as a way to plug in a HTTP implementation. To get started,
see the `AWS SDK for Java 2.0 Developer Guide`_.

Reporting issues
================

You can use the Issues_ section of this repository to report problems in the documentation. *When
submitting an issue, please indicate*:

* what page (a URL or filename is best) the issue occurs on.

* what the issue is, using as much detail as you can provide. For many issues, this might be as
  simple as "The page has a typo; the word 'complie' in the third paragraph shoud be 'compile'." If
  the issue is more complex, please describe it with enough detail that it's clear to the AWS
  documentation team what the problem is.


Contributing fixes and updates
==============================

To contribute your own documentation fixes or updates, please use the Github-standard procedures for
`forking the repository`_ and submitting a `pull request`_.

Note that many common substitutions_ and extlinks_ found in these docs are sourced from the `shared
content`_ repository--if you see a substitution used that is not declared at the top of the source
file or in the ``_includes.txt`` file, then it is probably defined in the shared content.


Building the documentation
--------------------------

If you are planning to contribute to the docs, you should build your changes and review them before
submitting your pull request.

**To build the docs:**

1. Make sure that you have downloaded and installed Sphinx_.
2. Run the ``build_docs.py`` script in the repository's root directory.

   ``build_docs.py`` can take any of the `available Sphinx builders`_ as its argument. For example,
   to build the docs into a single HTML page, you can use the ``singlehtml`` target, like so::

     python build_docs.py singlehtml

The build process will automatically download a snapshot of its dependencies, combine them in the
``doc_build`` directory and will then generate output into the ``doc_output`` directory.


Code examples in the documentation
----------------------------------

The code examples featured in this documentation can be found in a separate repository:
`aws-doc-sdk-examples <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/java>`_. Full
code and build files are included, so you can build and run any of the provided examples yourself.

In addition to examples in Java, you'll also find examples for each of the other AWS SDKs. If you
find issues with any of the examples, you can submit issues or fork the repository and submit a pull
request!

The code examples are provided under the *Apache 2.0* open source license. See the example
repository's `README <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for
more details.
