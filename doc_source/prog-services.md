# AWS SDK for Java Code Examples<a name="prog-services"></a>

This section provides tutorials and examples of using the AWS SDK for Java v1 to program AWS services\.

Find the source code for these examples and others in the AWS documentation [code examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)\.

To propose a new code example for the AWS documentation team to consider producing, create a new request\. The team is looking to produce code examples that cover broader scenarios and use cases, versus simple code snippets that cover only individual API calls\. For instructions, see the "Proposing new code examples" section in the [Readme on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/README.rst)\.
