Cloud security at {AWSlong} ({AWS}) is the highest priority. As an {AWS} customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Security is a shared responsibility between {AWS} and you. The  link:compliance/shared-responsibility-model/["Shared Responsibility Model", type="marketing"] describes this as Security of the Cloud and Security in the Cloud.

**Security of the Cloud**- {AWS} is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the {AWS} Cloud and providing you with services that you can use securely. Our security responsibility is the highest priority at {AWS}, and the effectiveness of our security is regularly tested and verified by third-party auditors as part of the link:compliance/programs/["pass:q[[.shared\]`AWS`] Compliance Programs", type="marketing"].

**Security in the Cloud**- Your responsibility is determined by the {AWS-service} you are using, and other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your organization's requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.
