How to handle exceptions thrown by the {sdk-java}.

Understanding how and when the {sdk-java} throws exceptions is important to building high-quality applications using the SDK. The following sections describe the different cases of exceptions that are thrown by the SDK and how to handle them appropriately.

[[why-unchecked-exceptions,why-unchecked-exceptions.title]]
== Why Unchecked Exceptions?

The {sdk-java} uses runtime (or unchecked) exceptions instead of checked exceptions for these reasons:



* To allow developers fine-grained control over the errors they want to handle without forcing them to handle exceptional cases they aren't concerned about (and making their code overly verbose)
* To prevent scalability issues inherent with checked exceptions in large applications

In general, checked exceptions work well on small scales, but can become troublesome as applications grow and become more complex.

For more information about the use of checked and unchecked exceptions, see:

[[amazonserviceexception-and-subclasses,amazonserviceexception-and-subclasses.title]]
== AmazonServiceException (and Subclasses)

link:sdk-for-java/v1/reference/com/amazonaws/AmazonServiceException.html["AmazonServiceException", type="documentation"] is the most common exception that you'll experience when using the {sdk-java}. This exception represents an error response from an {AWS-service}. For example, if you try to terminate an {EC2} instance that doesn't exist, EC2 will return an error response and all the details of that error response will be included in the `AmazonServiceException` that's thrown. For some cases, a subclass of `AmazonServiceException` is thrown to allow developers fine-grained control over handling error cases through catch blocks.

When you encounter an ``AmazonServiceException``, you know that your request was successfully sent to the {AWS-service} but couldn't be successfully processed. This can be because of errors in the request's parameters or because of issues on the service side.

`AmazonServiceException` provides you with information such as:



* Returned HTTP status code
* Returned {AWS} error code
* Detailed error message from the service
* {AWS} request ID for the failed request

`AmazonServiceException` also includes information about whether the failed request was the caller's fault (a request with illegal values) or the {AWS-service}'s fault (an internal service error).

[[amazonclientexception,amazonclientexception.title]]
== AmazonClientException

link:sdk-for-java/v1/reference/com/amazonaws/AmazonClientException.html["AmazonClientException", type="documentation"] indicates that a problem occurred inside the Java client code, either while trying to send a request to {AWS} or while trying to parse a response from {AWS}. An `AmazonClientException` is generally more severe than an ``AmazonServiceException``, and indicates a major problem that is preventing the client from making service calls to {AWS-services}. For example, the {sdk-java} throws an `AmazonClientException` if no network connection is available when you try to call an operation on one of the clients.
