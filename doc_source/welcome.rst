         Welcome to the AWS Java Developer Guide

################################
AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide
################################

The |sdk-java|_ provides a Java API for |AWSlong|. Using the SDK, you can easily build Java
applications that work with |S3|, |EC2|, |SDB|, and more. We regularly add support for new services
to the |sdk-java|. For a list of the supported services and their API versions that are included
with each release of the SDK, view the `Github Release notes <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java#release-notes>`_ for versions after 1.11.82. See `release notes`_ here for the older versions.


.. _additional-resources:

.. _eclipse-support:

Eclipse IDE Support
===================

If you develop code using the Eclipse IDE, you can use the |tke|_ to add the |sdk-java| to an
existing Eclipse project or to create a new |sdk-java| project. The toolkit also supports creating
and uploading |LAM| functions, launching and monitoring |EC2| instances, managing |IAM| users
and security groups, a |CFN| template editor, and more.

See the |tke-ug|_ for full documentation.


.. _android-support:

Developing AWS Applications for Android
=======================================

If you're an Android developer, |AWSlong| publishes an SDK made specifically for Android
development: the |sdk-android|_. See the |sdk-android-dg|_ for full documentation.


.. _java-sdk-history:

Viewing the SDK's Revision History
==================================

To view the release history of the |sdk-java|, including changes and supported services per SDK
version, see the SDK's `Github Release notes <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java#release-notes>`_ (for versions till 1.11.82, see `release notes`_ here).


.. _build-old-reference-docs:

Building Java Reference Documentation for Earlier SDK versions
==============================================================

The |sdk-java-ref|_ represents the most recent version of the SDK. If you're using an earlier SDK
version, you might want to access the SDK reference documentation that matches the version you're
using.

The easiest way to build the documentation is using Apache's Maven_ build tool. *Download and
install Maven first if you don't already have it on your system*, then use the following
instructions to build the reference documentation.

.. topic:: To build reference documentation for an earlier SDK version

    #. Locate and select the SDK version that you're using on the :github:`releases
       <aws/aws-sdk-java/releases>` page of the SDK repository on GitHub.

    #. Choose either the :file:`zip` (most platforms, including Windows) or :file:`tar.gz`
       (|unixes|) link to download the SDK to your computer.

    #. Unpack the archive to a local directory.

    #. On the command line, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the archive, and type the following.

       ::

        mvn javadoc:javadoc

    #. After building is complete, you'll find the generated HTML documentation in the
       :file:`aws-java-sdk/target/site/apidocs/` directory.
