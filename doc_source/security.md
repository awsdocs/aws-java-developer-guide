# Security for this AWS Product or Service<a name="security"></a>

Cloud security at Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) is the highest priority\. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security\-sensitive organizations\. Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you\. The [Shared Responsibility Model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as Security of the Cloud and Security in the Cloud\.

 **Security of the Cloud**\- AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud and providing you with services that you can use securely\. Our security responsibility is the highest priority at AWS, and the effectiveness of our security is regularly tested and verified by third\-party auditors as part of the [AWS Compliance Programs](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)\.

 **Security in the Cloud**\- Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service you are using, and other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your organizationâ€™s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations\.
